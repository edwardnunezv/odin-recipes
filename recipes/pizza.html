    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Chesse</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate the Yeast:

    In a small bowl, mix 1 packet of yeast with 1 teaspoon of sugar and ¾ cup of warm water (about 110°F/43°C).
    Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. If it doesn’t froth, the yeast might be old or the water too hot/cold.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Dough:

        In a large bowl, combine 2½ cups bread flour and 1 teaspoon salt.
        Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
        Stir until the dough starts to come together, then knead it on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. If it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
    <li>Let the Dough Rise:

            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Shape the Dough:

                Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a floured surface.
                Roll it out to your desired thickness, usually about ¼ inch thick. You can shape it into a round or rectangle depending on your preference.</li>

    </ol>
